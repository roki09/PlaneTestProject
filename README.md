# Airplane War
 
 This is my second project on the Unity engine, in this project I tried to create a high-quality project architecture, work with the particle system, improve my C# language skills, and much more

 ## Development plan

 At the moment the project is at an early stage of development, at the moment I am creating art of opponents, as well as creating particles.

In this game I use my own art:
